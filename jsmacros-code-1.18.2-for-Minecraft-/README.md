# jsmacros-code-1.18,2-for-Minecraft-
Javascript code used for botting farms.

The scripts that will be used are intended for 1.18.2 version of Minecraft; however, the scripts should also work well on older client versions. 
Place the scripts in AppData/Roaming/Minecraft/config/jsMacros/Macros.

The scripts are seperated into two different sections: old scripts that had predefined coordinates and tool usage and uninitialized generic ones. The old scripts are meant to showcase on how to define the variables that were used in Civclassics and Civ Revolutions. It's recommend that you install the generic scripts as a code schematic for determining on how to build your farm.
